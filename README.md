# Algorithm Practice & Problem Solving

Welcome to my personal repository of algorithm and data structure practice solutions.  

## Why this repo?

As a passionate programmer aiming to improve my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency, I regularly solve algorithmic challenges from platforms like LeetCode.  

This repository serves several purposes:  
- To **track my progress** over time in tackling various algorithm problems.  
- To **practice clean and efficient coding** by writing readable, well-documented solutions.  
- To build a portfolio that showcases my dedication and growth for potential employers and collaborators.  

## What you will find here

- Solutions to algorithmic problems including arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.  
- Code primarily written in Python (feel free to check out other languages in the future).  
- Well-structured and commented code to explain my thought process and approach.  

## How to use this repo

- Browse through the folders to find problem categories.  
- Each solution is accompanied by a brief explanation in comments.  
- Feedback and collaboration are welcome!

## Future goals

- Continue expanding this repo with more complex challenges and projects.
